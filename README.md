- async event-based non-blocking I/O
- ipv6
- BPF/eBPF
- blockchain and crypto
- binary decompilation
- emulation/virtualization
- coding best practices and patterns

## What I do for a living

I am currently working for *Kape Technologies (ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access)*  
where I deal with vpn technologies and advanced network engineering.  
I do both backend and frontend development of a Linux/macOS/Windows C++ Qt application.  

I have developed a solution for macOS Split Tunneling that uses event-based non-blocking I/O.  
It is able to proxy a high amount of udp/tcp packets with very low latency, while using minimal system resources.
