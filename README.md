### Hello there! 👋

I am a Software Engineer passionate about Software Architecture, Network Engineering and 3D Graphics.

I like system languages and I code mainly in C++.  
I develop on all desktop platforms, using Linux whenever is possible.  
I love and strongly support Free and Open source software ❤️

- proxies and firewalls
- async event-based non-blocking I/O
- ipv6
- BPF/eBPF
- blockchain and crypto
- binary decompilation
- emulation/virtualization
- coding patterns
- IoT devices
- 3D graphics
- game engines

## What I do for a living

I am currently working for *Kape Technologies (ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access)*  
where I deal with vpn technologies and advanced network engineering.  
I do both backend and frontend development of a Linux/macOS/Windows C++ Qt application.  

I have developed a solution for macOS Split Tunneling that uses event-based non-blocking I/O.  
It is able to proxy a high amount of udp/tcp packets with very low latency, while using minimal system resources.
